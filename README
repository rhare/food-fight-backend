CPSC-473 Food Fight Backend

This backend API uses DeployD with mongodb. package.json lists what is needed to use this api.

Requirements:
	- mongodb
		- Must be installed separtly
	- node v9.8
		- Installed on OS X using brew... brew install node
	- npm v5.7.1
		- Comes with node. I upgraded to 5.7.1 via npm install npm -g
			or maybe it was npm upgrade npm -g
	

Quick start:
	Install required node modules via:
		# this command will read package.json and install the requirements
		npm install .

	Run the script run_ff_api.sh.

	The script will start Mongodb as a daemon, start deployd using node, 
	and sit and wait until it receives an interrupt. If an interrupt is 
	received, deployd will stop and the mongod daemon will be stopped.

Script descriptions:
	The project has four differnt scripts for starting and stopping processes.

	start_mongod.sh
		- Starts mongod on port 27017 reading db on dbpath ./data/db
		- PID is saved to .mongod.pid
	stop_mongod.sh
		- Gets mongod PID from .mongod.pid
		- Kills mongod using PID
		- Empties .mongod.pid
	run_dpd.js
		- Starts deployd on port 2403 or port listed in env variable PORT
		- connects to mongodb on 127.0.0.1:27017 to the db name '-deployd'
	run_ff_api.sh
		- Runs start_mongod.sh
		- Using node, execute run_dpd.js (runs forever)
			- waits for INT
		- INT is caught and stop_mongod.sh is executed

DeployD layout:
	- collections
